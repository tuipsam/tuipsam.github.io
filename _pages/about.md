I'm a third year graduate student from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute (http://hvri.ac.cn/). My research interest includes virology, epidemiology, viral pathogenicity, and virus-host interaction.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhao Dongming](http://hvri.ac.cn/zzjg/cxtd/zyrsghbylxwlbyjcxtd/tdcy1/147003.htm) of [Zoonotic and Exotic infection Diseases Division](http://hvri.ac.cn/zzjg/cxtd/zyrsghbylxwlbyjcxtd/index.htm), Harbin Veterinary Research Institute. I was advised by [Prof. Peng Guangneng](https://dyy.sicau.edu.cn/info/1008/1903.htm) from [School of Veterinary Medicine](https://dyy.sicau.edu.cn/index.htm), Sichuan Agricultural University.

You can find my CV here: [Lianyu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
