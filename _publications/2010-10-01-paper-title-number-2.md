excerpt: 'African swine fever virus(ASFV) hasbeencirculating inChina formore thantwoyears, anditisnotclearwhether thebiological properties ofthevirus havechanged. Here, wereport onoursurveillance ofASFVs inseven provinces ofChina, fromJuneto December,2020. Atotalof22viruses were isolated andcharacterized asgenotype IIASFVs, withmutations, deletions, insertions, orshort-fragment replacement occurring inallisolates compared withPig/HLJ/2018 (HLJ/18), theearliest isolate in China. Eleven isolates hadfourdiffere nttypes ofnatural mutations ordeletion inthe EP402R gene anddisplayed anonhemadsorbing (non-HAD) phenotype. Fourisolates weretested forvirulence inpigs;twowerefound tobeashighly lethal as HLJ/18. However,twonon-HAD isolates showed lower virulence butwerehighly transmissible; infection with10 6 TCID50 dose waspartially lethal andcaused acute orsub-acute disease, whereas 103 TCID50 dosecaused non-lethal, sub-acute orchronic disease, andpersistent infection. Theemergence oflower virulent natural mutants brings greater difficulty totheearlydiagnosis ofASFandcreates newchallenges forASFV control.'
